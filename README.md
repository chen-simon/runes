# Runes
A AHK Keyboard and Translator for our modified version of the Anglo-Saxon runic alphabet.

- Run `rune.ahk` to enable the keyboard and press `Alt + R` to toggle between runic and english input. 
- Run `rune.py` to translate all the text in `input.txt` from the Latin alphabet to our Runic scripture to `output.txt`.
